# Pikachu-Detection
A use of two dimensional cross-correlation in order to find a point of maximum similarity and detect one or multiple pikachu amongst several different pokemon

Another demonstration of the handiness of cross-correlation in finding similarities between images. This seemed like an easy enough project provided that one could properly handle the image processing and figure out how to detect multiple instances of the template (Pikachu) within the image. The actual cross-correlation algorithm is deceptively simple to implement given the spooky-looking equation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation). Using the numpy function correlate2d proved to be rather unfruitful probably because the output size ended up being different, in all cases, than the size of the image. Another setback in implementing a correlation algorithm independently was the unusual occurence that, in multiplying the values of the array together, the parts of the image that contained the most white space ended up with the highest correlation, erroniously. Discovered through the visual aid of 2D-heatmaps, it only made sense that this was because multiplying two numbers such as 150 * 255 will of course return higher than multiplying 150 * 150. Thus, a Z-Normalization was used to normalize the pixels to a proper range of [-1, 1]. This displayed immediate success, the reason being that if a positive number is multiplied by a (not so similar) pixel with a negative value, it will detract from the correlation.
